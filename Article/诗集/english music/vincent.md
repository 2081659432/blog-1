Starry, starry night
繁星点点的夜裡
paint your palette blue and grey
画出你调色盘裡的蓝与灰
look out on a summer's day
在夏日裡出外探访
with eyes that know the darkness in my soul.
用你那洞悉我灵魂幽暗处的双眼
Shadows on the hills
山丘上的阴影
sketch the trees and the daffodils
描绘出树林与水仙花
catch the breeze and the winter chills
捕捉微风与冬天的冷冽
in colors on the snowy linen land.
用那雪地裡亚麻般的色彩
And now I understand
如今我才明白
what you tried to say to me
你想说的是什麼
and how you suffered for your sanity
当你清醒时你有多麼痛苦
and how you tried to set them free.
你努力的想让它们得到解脱
They would not listen they did not know how
但人们却不理会，也不知该怎麼做
perhaps they'll listen now.
也许，人们将学会倾听
Starry starry night
繁星点点的夜裡
flaming flowers that brightly blaze
火红的花朵灿烂的燃烧著
swirling clouds in violet haze
漩涡似的云飘在紫罗兰色的雾裡
reflect in Vincent's eyes of China blue.
映照在文生湛蓝的眼瞳裡
Colors changing hue
色彩变化万千
morning fields of amber grain
清晨的田园裡琥珀色的农作物
weathered faces lined in pain
佈满风霜的脸上罗列著痛苦
are smoothed beneath the artist's loving hand.
在艺术家怜爱的手下得到抚慰
And now I understand
如今我才明白
what you tried to say to me
你想说的是什麼
and how you suffered for your sanity
当你清醒时你有多麼痛苦
and how you tried to set them free.
你努力的想让它们得到解脱
They would not listen they did not know how
但人们却不理会，也不知该怎麼做
perhaps they'll listen now.
也许，人们将学会倾听
For they could not love you
因為当初他们无法爱你
but still your love was true
但你的爱依然真切
and when no hope was left in sight on that
当灿烂的星空裡
starry starry night.
不存一丝希望
You took your life as lovers often do,
你像许多恋人一样，结束了自己的生命
But I could have told you Vincent
但愿我能告诉你，文森特
this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you.
这个世界根本配不上一个美丽如你的人
Starry starry night
繁星点点的夜裡
portraits hung in empty halls
frameless heads on nameless walls
无镶框的脸倚靠在不知名的墙上
with eyes that watch the world and can't forget.
配上一双看遍世事且永不遗忘的双眼
Like the stranger that you've met
就像你曾遇见的陌生人
the ragged men in ragged clothes
那些衣衫襤褸的人们
the silver thorn of bloddy rose
也像血红的玫瑰上银色的刺
lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow.
断裂并静卧在初下的雪上
And now I think I know
我想我已明白
what you tried to say to me
你想说的是什麼
and how you suffered for your sanity
当你清醒时你有多麼痛苦
and how you tried to set them free.
你努力的想让它们得到解脱
They would not listen they're not listening still
但人们却不理会，现在依然如此
perhaps they never will.
也许，他们永远不会……
